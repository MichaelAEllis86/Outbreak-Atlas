              Outbreak Atlas is a illness symptom tracking application that is designed to track community illness trends and
              empower users to report, monitor, and understand local outbreaks across the United States. 
              It allows users to see trends at three different levels of locality, national, state, and zipcode over a two month period.
              These trends are generated from two different sources of data detailed in the section below. Data is visualized via charts and graphs
              that are direct and easily digestable.

              We combine official public health sources with self-reported data
              to give a richer, real-time picture of outbreaks. For public health data, we use data sourced from the CDC's Fluview Surveillance Network 
              <Link href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" underline="hover"color="primary"> CDC FluView </Link> and obtained

              The CDC Fluview (ILInet) network is a surveillance network of ~ 3000 volunteer outpatient health services 
              (Clinics/Pediatric Clinics/Urgent Care/Ambulatory Care/Student Health Centers etc). These outpatient services report the number of patients seen,
              and the number of patients ill with a flu-like respiratory illness (ILI). This data is available at the national and state level.

                We allow users to create a simple account and self report their own symptoms quickly and easily. These symptom reports include several common symptoms such as cough, cold, fever,
                nausea, chills, headache, fatigue etc. Users also report severity of symptoms (mild, moderate, severe), any associated temperature or fever in degrees ¬∞F, additional notes or comments,
                their zipcode and state where the symptoms occured, and they have the option to allow location services to take more precise coordinates of their report for mapping purposes. This allows 
                for symptom data to be generated quickly by the user without the need for a doctor visit or testing confirmation. We then aggregate this data and can group it in various ways such as by symptoms, categories of symptoms
                such as dermal, respiratory, gastrointestinal etc, severity, state, and zipcode.

              How to Read the Charts
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" color="text.secondary">
              Line charts show trends over time, such as how many reports per week or patient visits per week for a given locality.  Bar charts break down counts by
              category such as age group, and pie charts highlight proportions such as what portion of reports contained coughing or fever symptoms. We strive to make our reports simple and easy to read with minimal
              medical knowledge or jargon. However, when reading CDC flu surveillance data there are a few key terms to consider. Please see below.
              <Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom color="primary"> üîé What is ILI or an ill patient?</Typography>
              <Typography variant="body1" color="text.secondary"> 
              When reading %/percentage of ill patient line graphs from the CDC, an ill patient (ILI/wILI) qualifies as having a fever/temperature ‚â• 100¬∞F/37.8¬∞C plus an associated flu symptom
              such as a cough or sore throat. These reports are aggregated and also weighted (wILI) to account for differing population size and health provider coverage throughout different states.
              It is a faster paced system of illness surveillance which can be aggregated and calculated at much faster speeds that waiting for confirmed test cases (although the CDC does have this data in separate areas).
              Thus, one can interpret the percentage of wILI patients ill line graphs we display as a measure of number of patients with fever/temperature ‚â• 100¬∞F/37.8¬∞C and flu-like respiratory symptoms as a total percentage of the number of patients seen at outpatient clinics, 
              then weighted for population.

              <Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom color="error"> üö´ What is ILI is not!</Typography>
               <Typography variant="body1" color="text.secondary"> 
                It is not a laboratory confirmation of influenza virus. There is no swab or verification of viral nucleic acids (DNA/RNA) via PCR(Polymerase Chain Reaction) a paramount
                method to scientifically verify presence of the virus which was extensively used in covid 19 laboratory testing . Rather, it is outpatient symptom-based surveillance.
                Therefore, these symptoms could be caused by different illnesses such as RSV, covid, a cold or other common respiratory-based viruses or bacteria.

               <Typography variant="body1" color="text.secondary"> 
                The baseline represents the expected level of influenza-like illness (ILI) in the U.S. during non-influenza weeks, as defined by the CDC. In other words, it‚Äôs the ‚Äúnormal background noise‚Äù of respiratory illness that happens every year, even outside of flu season.
                On our charts, the baseline is shown as a dashed horizontal line. If the observed percentage of patients with ILI rises above this line, it indicates that flu activity is higher than expected seasonal background levels.

              below average activity for a given point in time. If cases are above this baseline then activity is above average. See additional explanations about how to read charts in the corresponding
