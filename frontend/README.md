## ü©∫ Project Overview

**Outbreak Atlas** is a full-stack web application designed to track and visualize public health data across the United States. It integrates **real-world epidemiological APIs** (such as the US Center for Disease Control's (CDC‚Äôs) *ILINet Influenza Surveillance* dataset via Carnegie Melon University's Delphi API) with **user-submitted symptom reports** to help identify emerging illness trends.

My goal in the creation of this project is to create a small application where the user experience for checking for USA epidemiological trends can be easy, centralized, and succinct providing an experience similar to checking the weather for a given locality.

Users can:
- Explore CDC-reported flu surveillance data through interactive charts and visualizations.
- Explore user submitted illness report trends that have been contributed directly to the Outbreak-Atlas site.
- Explore 3 levels of data locality: national, state, and 5 digit zipcode.
- Submit their own anonymous illness reports to contribute to community-driven health surveillance.
- View their own report history and account details in a secure, personalized dashboard.
  

To ensure the user experiences data that is relevant as well as up to date we feature data from two key sources that provide different and complementary strengths (see below).



### üîç Epidemiological Data Sources we use
 
#### 1.  CDC ILINet Influenza Surveillance (fluview)  CDC links-> https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/ & https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/overview/index.html API Link: https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/fluview.html Carnegie Melon University Delphi Research Group -> https://delphi.cmu.edu/

 For public health data, we use data sourced from the CDC's Fluview Surveillance Network CDC FluView and obtained through Carnegie Melon University's Delphi Research Group Epidata API via the fluview API Endpoint. The CDC Fluview (ILInet) network is a surveillance network of ~ 3000 volunteer outpatient health services (Clinics/Pediatric Clinics/Urgent Care/Ambulatory Care/Student Health Centers etc). These outpatient services report the number of patients seen, and the number of patients ill with a flu-like respiratory illness (ILI). An ill patient is qualified as having a fever/body temperature of over 100 
 ¬∞F and having >2 flu-like respiratory symptoms. This data is available at the national and state level. Read more about the CDC influenza surveillance network in the links above.

 #### 2. User Submitted Symptom Reports

 We allow users to create a simple account and self report their own symptoms quickly and easily. These symptom reports include several common symptoms such as cough, cold, fever, nausea, chills, headache, fatigue etc. Users also report severity of symptoms (mild, moderate, severe), any associated temperature or fever in degrees ¬∞F, additional notes or comments, their zipcode and state where the symptoms occured, and they have the option to allow location services to take more precise coordinates of their report for mapping purposes. This allows for symptom data to be generated quickly by the user without the need for a doctor visit or testing confirmation. We then aggregate this data and can group it in various ways such as by symptoms, categories of symptoms such as dermal, respiratory, gastrointestinal etc, severity, state, and zipcode.

 User symptom reports serve as a useful supplment to CDC public health data. Government structured public health data ensures accuracy and veracity of the information, but is often 1-2 weeks an minimum out of date as all of this reporting requires time and analysis. This time delay can be even longer when looking for presence of laboratory confirmed cases of illness. Self-reported data lacks the institutional verification and accuracy but can reveal illness trends in local communities or subcommunities like schools, nursing homes, etc more quickly. It also has the ability cover cases that go unreported officially and do not go through the U.S. healthcare system expanding the potential scope of the data. There are many legitimate challenges in reporting disease at the government level. Not all sick people have access to medical care for example, or they may choose not to seek medical attention for minor illnesses like cold and flu. Outbreak Atlas therefore combines both government CDC fluview surveillance and user-reported symptoms to take advantage of the strengths of both data types.

## üß© Features

### ü¶†üåç 1. National & State CDC fluview Trends
- Displays **CDC Influenza-like Illness (ILI)** trends using interactive bar and line charts.
- Visualizes flu-like illness totals by week and age group.
- Aggregates user-reported data for local insights (e.g., zip code or state).

### üò∑üìä 2. National, State, and Zipcode User report trends
- Displays Trends using interactive bar, line, and pie charts
- Visualizes data by number of reports in a given locality.
- Visualizes data categorically by types of symptoms exhibited and severity.

### 3.üîçüåç Location Queries
   - Search by state for CDC fluview and user report trends
   - Search by zipcode for user report trends
   - National data is available on the home page for both data sources

### 4.üìç Local Trends for Users
   - Login grants access to trend reports for users local area
   - available at state and zipcode levels of granularity.

### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë 5. User Accounts
- Secure registration and login via JWT authentication.
- Users can **edit their account details** or **view their report history** from their dashboard.
- Middleware ensures only authorized users or admins can access sensitive routes.

### üßæ 6. Report an Illness
- Interactive form to submit new reports with:
  - Symptom selection
  - Severity level
  - Temperature and geolocation (state, zip)
